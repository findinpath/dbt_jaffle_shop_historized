# For jaffle_shop, a single generic identifier is sufficient.  We'll prefix
# all named identifiers with something that indicates what they are - cust1, order1, etc
identifiers:
  - identifier: order_id_generator
    attributes:
      - field: id

# Typically, we have a separate scenario for each target table, however your
# project's needs may differ.
scenarios:

  - scenario: Building fct_orders out of the raw_orders when the fct_orders table contains already an entry with the same order date as the new staging entry

    cases:
      - case: >
          The historized `fct_orders` table contains already a few entries corresponding to `order1`.
          The new entry corresponding to the `order1` from the stage table `stg_orders` has the date `2018-01-03`
          which is the same as the last date historized for `order1` in `fct_orders`.
          Due to the fact that `load_id` from the staging table is greater as the one from the fact table, the
          entry shoul be correctly interpreted as a new entry and should therefor end the validity of the entry
          from the fact table.
