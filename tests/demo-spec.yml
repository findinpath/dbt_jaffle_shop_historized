# For jaffle_shop, a single generic identifier is sufficient.  We'll prefix
# all named identifiers with something that indicates what they are - cust1, order1, etc
identifiers:
  - identifier: order_id_generator
    attributes:
      - field: id
        generator: unique_integer

# All the raw sources used in jaffle_shop
sources:

  - source: raw_orders
    identifier_map:
      - column: order_id
        identifier:
          name: order_id_generator
          attribute: id


# We could test more of the models built by dbt.  But at the end of the day,
# we really only care about the tables that our end users use.
targets:

  - target: fct_orders
    identifier_map:
      - column: order_id
        identifier:
          name: order_id_generator
          attribute: id


# Typically, we have a separate scenario for each target table, however your
# project's needs may differ.
scenarios:
  - scenario: Building fct_orders out of the raw_orders when the fct_orders table is empty

    cases:
      - case: >
          Basic full refresh loading of the historized fact table `fct_orders`

          Tested scenarios:
          - order1 : the expected historized entries should follow the representation: placed > shipped > completed
          - order2 : the expected historized entries should follow the representation: placed
          - order3 : contains duplicated (with the same `updated_at` and `status` values) entries.
          The duplicates should be filtered out from the processing.
          The expected historized entries should follow the representation: placed > shipped > return_pending
